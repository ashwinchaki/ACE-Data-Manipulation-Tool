{"name":"ACE Data Analyzer","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to the ACE Data Analyzer\r\nThis tool is designed for manipulation and analysis of ACE data.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nTo run the files (located here with the names of the games, where the rest are just outputs and such), simply add them to the /documents/matlab folder (on both Windows and OS X / Linux / Unix) and then type the name of the function and the filename in parentheses.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the discrimination function, you would do: (assuming the file is in the Inputs directory, which it should be)\r\n\r\ndiscrimination('./Inputs/foo.csv')\r\n\r\nmake sure to use single quotes as matlab doesn't register double quotes as strings.\r\n\r\nIf the files are in a directory underneath (such as /users/me/documents/matlab/exportdata) or something similar, you can either:\r\n\r\nput in the full name\r\n\r\ndiscrimination('/users/me/documents/matlab/exportdata/foo.csv')\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\ndiscrimination('./exportdata/foo.csv') - assuming that you're currently in ./documents/matlab (to check type pwd)\r\n\r\nThese are designed for Linux / OS X use. If Windows is the host operating system, be sure to format the directory structures (input arguments, as well as outputs in the actual source code) accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project is maintained by Ashwin Chakicherla","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
